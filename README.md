Simple Calculator
Overview
This is a simple calculator application designed to perform basic arithmetic operations. It's a foundational project to demonstrate skills in Python and serves as a great starting point for understanding user input, conditional logic, and function-based programming.

Features
Addition: Add two numbers.

Subtraction: Subtract one number from another.

Multiplication: Multiply two numbers.

Division: Divide one number by another (includes error handling for division by zero).

User-Friendly Interface: Clear, text-based prompts for easy interaction.

How to Run
Clone the repository:

git clone git@github.com:M-Ogola/PLP.git

Navigate to the project directory:

cd PLP

Run the script:

python Calculator.py

Technology Stack
Language: Python

Version Control: Git

Hosting: GitHub

Future Enhancements (Ideas for V2)
[ ] Add support for more complex operations (e.g., exponents, square roots).

[ ] Create a graphical user interface (GUI) instead of a text-based one.

[ ] Implement a loop to allow continuous calculations without restarting the program.

[ ] Handle invalid input gracefully (e.g., if the user enters a letter instead of a number).
